How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    pinpoints where you made changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can use older versions as bases for new files.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You control what goes public. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Just different systems.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  Git lgo - shows commits/ git diff - compares version of same file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    You can also revert back if you make a mistake. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    code.
